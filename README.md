Once I had taken awhile to figure out what I wanted to do for this project the coding up of this took me around 20mins. The project randomizes the main powerlifts complete with random rep and set range. I plan to build on this project in the future by creating the ability to save the random exercises with additional user input of weight used and store in a database for further data manipulation.
